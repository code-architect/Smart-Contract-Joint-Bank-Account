# Sample Joint Bank Account
This need to support multiple account owners, so joint banck account

1. For an account we need to know the owners of the account
2. Balance of that account
3. Making a withdrawl request
4. Deposit to the account if they are owners
5. Every single owner needs to approve a withdrawl. So the steps are requesting a withdrawl, approving the withdrawl and taking the withdrawl

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx kill-port <port numbrt>
```
